# On client side we have cookies 

# and On server side we have session 


- Cookie and session both are used to store data, but cookies store data on "browser" / "client side" / "frontend", and session stores data on "server side" / wherever your "backend" is deployed there. 

- "Session" is more safer than "cookies" because data is not directly accessible to the user and it cannot be manipulated when it is stored on server 


# But why do we still use cookies then?
