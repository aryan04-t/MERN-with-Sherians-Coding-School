# What are template engines:

- A mark up style which later gets converted into html 

- we can add dynamic values to our html using template engines 



### Some different template engine examples:

* pug, handlebars, ejs, jade. 


- We're going to use ejs, because it looks like html, but it is not html, it is ejs which is then converted in html by ejs module and then served to the browser 

- pug and jade has indentation like python, the don't have mark up view similar to html
